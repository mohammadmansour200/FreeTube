# FreeTube: a Youtube video player clone


## 💡 About
---
A YouTube video player clone with nearly all main functionalities and cross-device responsiveness designed to closely resemble YouTube's interface with vanilla JS with no libraries whatsoever.


## ⚙️ Features
---
✅ A working playlist that allows you to play videos included in the list seamlessly 
✅ Fully responsive video player with nearly all main functionalities like captions, playback speed, double tap to seek/rewind, fullscreen mode (doesn't work on iPhone unfortunately), mini-player mode, theater mode etc.
✅ User-friendly interface closely resembling YouTube's design


## 🚀 Planned improvements
---
I want it to be a more bigger project, I want it to be a fully-functional Youtube-like platform that respects the Shariah-law, I see tremendous potential in that and what I made according to me is a promising start for that.
