00:00.510 --> 00:03.000
Imagine someone broke into your house

2
00:03.030 --> 00:06.060
then attacked your father and
siblings, what will you do in this case?

3
00:06.090 --> 00:08.610
surely you will break
the ceiling over his head

4
00:08.640 --> 00:12.705
but, will you do the same thing if this guy
didn't break into your house and instead

5
00:12.730 --> 00:14.400
broke into the house beside you?

6
00:14.430 --> 00:15.840
ok, what about he broke into a house

7
00:15.840 --> 00:17.730
in a different street.... in a different
state

8
00:17.880 --> 00:21.150
in every situation, the severity
of the reaction will decrease

9
00:21.150 --> 00:24.463
surely, this is what the borders
between countries made to us

10
00:24.723 --> 00:28.636
"From a different angle"

11
00:28.920 --> 00:31.260
in 1916,

12
00:31.320 --> 00:33.240
two well known Army generals got together

13
00:33.300 --> 00:36.060
whom we can call "The
Middle East Engineers",

14
00:36.120 --> 00:37.620
Mark Sykes and Georges Picot

15
00:37.710 --> 00:39.540
to sign a secret agreement

16
00:39.690 --> 00:41.730
for the partition of the "Fertile Crescent"

17
00:41.760 --> 00:43.560
between France and Britain

18
00:43.560 --> 00:46.410
to define their spheres of
influence and control in west Asia

19
00:46.650 --> 00:51.180
moreover, to partition the Ottoman empire
which was the controling that region

20
00:51.300 --> 00:52.950
in the first World War

21
00:53.250 --> 00:55.800
and it happened to
grant this agreement

22
00:55.830 --> 00:59.610
a delusional legitimacy to the
western colonizers of our lands

23
00:59.670 --> 01:01.110
but on the other side

24
01:01.310 --> 01:03.800
creating [unintentionally]
resistance fighter

25
01:03.900 --> 01:06.780
this resistance that was scattered across

26
01:06.780 --> 01:08.070
many different countries

27
01:08.100 --> 01:12.960
after we were a one entity
bringing it together a one Caliph

28
01:13.140 --> 01:15.060
throughout those long decades

29
01:15.510 --> 01:19.600
for the first time, the resistance
has become exposed and scattered

30
01:19.860 --> 01:20.730
behind the bounderies

31
01:20.760 --> 01:22.290
for every resistance becoming just

32
01:22.560 --> 01:25.440
a partial resistance that only focuses
on its own country,

33
01:25.530 --> 01:27.150
focusing on its own independence.

34
01:27.296 --> 01:28.296
Independence came

35
01:28.530 --> 01:30.303
and our countries started
getting its own independence

36
01:30.327 --> 01:31.830
in isolation from its
Neighboring countries

37
01:32.160 --> 01:34.200
then we started hearing about Nationalism

38
01:34.470 --> 01:37.650
a movement that revolves individuals
around the borders of their state

39
01:38.040 --> 01:41.880
and it makes them forget their greater
belonging, their affiliation to Islam!.

40
01:41.910 --> 01:45.360
In the past the boundaries
were flexible and wasn't that strict

41
01:45.360 --> 01:46.440
like nowadays.

42
01:46.590 --> 01:49.560
in addition to that, it was
changing over time

43
01:49.800 --> 01:51.630
and people didn't pay any attention to it

44
01:51.660 --> 01:55.170
thus the boundaries of Egypt,
the Levant, the Hijaz and Morocco

45
01:55.170 --> 01:57.390
occasionally narrow and widen over time

46
01:57.480 --> 01:59.070
and the only constant thing was

47
01:59.340 --> 02:01.680
the unity of people and Islamic brotherhood.

48
02:01.710 --> 02:03.390
Politicians were fighting [over ruling]

49
02:03.510 --> 02:05.610
and Countries were toppling each other

50
02:05.790 --> 02:08.610
however the nation was
cohesive and united together

51
02:08.730 --> 02:11.940
moreover, the Egyptian wasn't preventing
his Morrocan brother from having a Visa

52
02:12.180 --> 02:13.665
and People defended neighboring Countries

53
02:13.689 --> 02:15.120
without it being in their boundaries

54
02:15.120 --> 02:17.760
because all Muslim countries are considered their own country

55
02:17.910 --> 02:21.090
and every oppresser on Islamic land
in far East

56
02:21.300 --> 02:23.760
is an oppresser on their houses in far West.

57
02:23.910 --> 02:25.020
From a different angle:

58
02:25.500 --> 02:27.990
do you remember the nationality of Salah ad-Din al-Ayyubi?

59
02:28.380 --> 02:29.490
Saif ad-Din Qutuz?

60
02:29.700 --> 02:30.720
what about al-Zahir Baybars?

61
02:30.930 --> 02:32.280
do you know it?

62
02:32.340 --> 02:34.650
you might now the nationalism of Suleiman al-Halabi

63
02:34.830 --> 02:36.420
which is obvious from his name

64
02:36.630 --> 02:37.920
Aleppian from the Levants

65
02:37.950 --> 02:40.170
but when you learned about him in School,

66
02:40.230 --> 02:43.260
did he kill Kléber for the occupation of the Levants or Egypt?

67
02:43.306 --> 02:46.740
this was our determination before
Sykes broke it

68
02:46.740 --> 02:47.781
and Picot messed with it.

69
02:47.806 --> 02:51.510
One united nation rises for one enemy

70
02:51.750 --> 02:55.350
a nation where an Egyptian
fights alongside a Levant,

71
02:55.560 --> 02:57.960
a Hijazi defends a Iraqi

72
02:58.140 --> 03:00.790
and Morocans call Sudanese for help

73
03:00.870 --> 03:02.820
One nation with a unified heart,

74
03:03.030 --> 03:06.390
united as one, they empathize
with the suffering of a single body

75
03:06.450 --> 03:09.180
thus no one heard about the Occupation of Palestine

76
03:09.210 --> 03:10.350
and nibbled his lips

77
03:10.350 --> 03:12.540
or said: Egypt is for Egyptians,

78
03:12.660 --> 03:14.670
and we have no relation with Palestinian childs

79
03:14.700 --> 03:17.040
but intead Salah ad-Din
(whose from Tikrit in Iraq)

80
03:17.280 --> 03:19.106
went to Levants to reform it,

81
03:19.260 --> 03:22.240
then, to Egypt to free it from the Fatimids

82
03:22.350 --> 03:24.270
and from there went towards Palestine

83
03:24.300 --> 03:26.220
to liberate it from the
hands of the Crusaders

84
03:26.250 --> 03:29.970
But when the occupation had sown its seeds within us [Nationalism seeds],

85
03:30.090 --> 03:34.500
many of us became oblivious to what is happening nearby

86
03:34.530 --> 03:38.460
and ironically Westerns has alleviated
from Nationalism

87
03:38.670 --> 03:41.100
and became having Military alliances,

88
03:41.250 --> 03:42.750
things like European single market,

89
03:42.775 --> 03:43.980
Euro currency

90
03:44.225 --> 03:46.025
and there they are coming out

91
03:46.050 --> 03:47.580
in joint statements

92
03:47.760 --> 03:49.650
supporting the occupiers and oppressors

93
03:49.890 --> 03:53.400
while we see our brothers in Gaza are
under bombardments in helpless silence

94
03:53.640 --> 03:56.970
and we don't hear any statements
supporting them materially

95
03:57.210 --> 03:58.810
or even morally!

96
03:58.920 --> 04:01.060
O Muslim Ummah, till
when will this continue?
