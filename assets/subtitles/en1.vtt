"Murder of more than 1000 Israeli

2
00:02.385 --> 00:04.650
as a result of Hamas's atack"

3
00:04.740 --> 00:08.790
this was the content of one of
the recent news from the BBC

4
00:08.880 --> 00:12.510
that will also tell you that
Palestineans kill Zionists

5
00:12.753 --> 00:14.133
without telling you the reason

6
00:14.158 --> 00:17.147
furthermore, they will tell
you that palestinians died..

7
00:17.172 --> 00:19.020
with no info. at all
about how they died

8
00:19.200 --> 00:20.460
"they just died" according to 
western media

9
00:20.550 --> 00:21.831
but when it comes to Zionists

10
00:21.855 --> 00:23.010
they mourn and sob.

11
00:23.040 --> 00:25.920
This is the distorted perception
of Western media

12
00:25.950 --> 00:27.210
that weakens the palestinian cause in us

13
00:27.436 --> 00:30.596
and who we'll not allow
to do so

14
00:30.979 --> 00:34.085
"From a different angle"

15
00:34.560 --> 00:38.280
although the bloodsheding
the Zionists are doing

16
00:38.310 --> 00:42.240
to Palestinians, specifically these days

17
00:42.510 --> 00:44.700
of war crimes against
palestinians in Gaza

18
00:45.060 --> 00:47.354
the Western media has mastered the

19
00:47.378 --> 00:50.010
art of double standards
and selective silence

20
00:50.070 --> 00:50.908
in front of what is happening

21
00:50.940 --> 00:53.370
in France numerous
protests was organized by

22
00:53.370 --> 00:57.030
the Representative
Council of Jewish Institutions

23
00:57.030 --> 00:59.520
to support the Zionist entity

24
00:59.550 --> 01:02.940
while protests for Palestine is forbidden

25
01:02.970 --> 01:05.745
not only that, it goes as far as
for the Minister of Justice of France

26
01:05.769 --> 01:10.200
to threaten those who sympathize
with Gaza with imprisonment

27
01:10.260 --> 01:14.040
in addition to that, in the UK the
"civilized", UK's minister of interior forbids

28
01:14.070 --> 01:18.335
just the waving of the
Palestinian flag, or chanting

29
01:18.360 --> 01:19.890
slogans calling for
Palestine's freedom

30
01:20.070 --> 01:23.850
along with that, the German President
himself comes out to warn his civilians

31
01:24.046 --> 01:27.586
from praising or sympathizing with Hamas.

32
01:27.660 --> 01:29.520
Have you seen effrontery like that

33
01:29.670 --> 01:33.960
from those who chant
democracy and liberalism slogans?

34
01:33.985 --> 01:38.185
from a few months they were
crying over their beloved Ukraine,

35
01:38.430 --> 01:41.230
 which was under attack by the Russians

36
01:41.280 --> 01:43.160
so they hanged
banners, changed the

37
01:43.184 --> 01:46.350
color of their channels
and major occaisons

38
01:46.530 --> 01:48.150
to Ukraine's flag color

39
01:48.420 --> 01:50.627
moreover, they even funded Ukrainian

40
01:50.651 --> 01:53.100
extremists to defend their country

41
01:53.310 --> 01:56.160
with 24/7 media coverage

42
01:56.340 --> 01:58.410
but when it comes to Palestine

43
01:58.590 --> 02:00.930
defending their rights = extremism

44
02:01.170 --> 02:06.510
while oppressors are innocent civilians,
whom western celebrities sympathize with

45
02:06.690 --> 02:09.720
but it's forbidden for our Arab
celebrities to sympathize with them

46
02:09.750 --> 02:12.150
especially who lives in the West

47
02:12.420 --> 02:15.390
and indeed there who has got afraid

48
02:15.630 --> 02:18.030
and there who was brave enough

49
02:18.210 --> 02:20.820
to express about the Palestinian cause.

50
02:20.877 --> 02:22.162
Many times we wonder, is our

51
02:22.186 --> 02:24.657
engagement in Social
media about the cause

52
02:24.750 --> 02:26.880
benefiting our brothers in palestine?

53
02:27.270 --> 02:28.980
and are we allowed to blame

54
02:28.980 --> 02:31.097
the apathetic celebrities who had abstained

55
02:31.121 --> 02:33.420
from doing any engagement in this cause?

56
02:33.570 --> 02:37.224
firstly, we all know that the algorithms
of the majority of

57
02:37.236 --> 02:40.830
Social media platforms, restricts
the content related to Palestine

58
02:40.920 --> 02:44.160
moreover, it doesn't deal equally with it
and Zionist content

59
02:44.190 --> 02:46.890
additionally, the selective silence and racism we see

60
02:46.890 --> 02:50.310
towards the palestinian cause, tells us 
without a doubt

61
02:50.460 --> 02:53.670
about the worldwide lack of
knowledge about this cause

62
02:53.700 --> 02:58.260
not all Europeans are
necessarily against us

63
02:58.440 --> 03:02.190
but they might haven't heard
anything about the cause

64
03:02.460 --> 03:04.800
this lack of knowledge
was made by their media

65
03:04.950 --> 03:08.160
so our media must do the opposite

66
03:08.185 --> 03:14.860
we all should take advantage of media
to spread this cause by ourselves

67
03:14.910 --> 03:17.191
in addition to that, to
feel that we're one people

68
03:17.216 --> 03:19.140
and spread this cause worldwide

69
03:19.200 --> 03:21.631
for that, I am
sending this message

70
03:21.655 --> 03:23.790
to all Arabic and
Islamic content creators:

71
03:24.056 --> 03:27.510
"Our cause needs [loud]
voices, you and us are its voice,

72
03:27.690 --> 03:28.590
so don't hesitate to spread it"

73
03:28.650 --> 03:30.630
the loud voices results in a fuss

74
03:30.780 --> 03:32.787
which means more audience and more

75
03:32.811 --> 03:34.950
knowledge about the
crimes of the Zionists

76
03:35.130 --> 03:37.740
and the right for
palestinians to resist back

77
03:38.040 --> 03:40.710
and all of us can participate in this

78
03:40.830 --> 03:43.540
so don't underestimate your potentials.
